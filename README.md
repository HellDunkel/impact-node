impact-node
===========

This package includes Node.js server for ImpactJS backend, as well as [Impact++](https://github.com/roman01la/impactplusplus) npm package and merging util to start things faster.

Clone this repo:

`git clone git@github.com:roman01la/impact-node.git`

Put your `impact` folder into `impact-node` directory and run:

`node merge && npm start`

The first command will merge ImpactJS files with Impact++ and put everything into `public` folder, and the second one will start the server. You'll need to merge files just once.
